## Site Link

## Usage

On the landing page you will be met with our recommended meal and cocktail. The user can navigate between pages via the navbar. Once on the meal or cocktail page, type into the search bar for a recipe. After the user clicks the search bar, a list of recipes including the keywords will display a card containing a picture of the completed recipe, ingredient list, how-to directions, and a link to a video tutorial for the recipe.
